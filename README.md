A single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

[Live Version]( https://sumanhakki.github.io/pixel-art-maker/)

## Usage
- Pick a height and width value for your canvas. Fill grids with the color pallete. More grids (a bigger canvas) allow you to put in more detail.
- The ` Submit ` button is used to create your canvas, as well as a quick way to erase all the coloring on your canvas. If you are unhappy with your masterpice and want to start over with the same size canvas, just hit the ` Submit ` button to start with a clean slate.
- If you make a **_mistake_** on a single or multiple cells, just pick **_white_** as your color and click the cells that need correction.
